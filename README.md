# py-bca-qubit
Python hashing function for the Qubit blockchain algorithm

# Source
The source code was obtained from the coinhash github repo. I created this repo 
as something within my own control for availability.

Most of the qubit source code is original from the RNRT SAPHIR project.

The qubitmodule does not contain any license information, and I don't know who
wrote it originaly.

# Python versions
This package should be usable with Python2.7 and Python3.x.
